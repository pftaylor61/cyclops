## Description

This is the Cyclops theme, from Old Castle Web Solutions. It is designed for a knowledge based 'wiki' style website, and works best with the Encyclopedia Lite plugin. 
The theme has been developed from the Bootstrap Basic4 theme, designed by Vee Winch, of Runwiz. This is how he describes the theme:
Bootstrap v.4 basic theme. For build new theme based on Bootstrap 4. (WordPress 5 or Gutenberg ready.)
The concept is to keep it basic, no rich features, no additional functions; all of these for theme developers will be easier to start develop their theme.
If the theme contain too many options, some of those options maybe no need by the others it will be waste of time to find and remove.
It is still keep the same concept as Bootstrap Basic (version 1) which is minimal, just basic, easy to start build your own theme whether it is for new parent theme or child theme.

To make Bootstrap 4 work in older Internet Explorer (IE) please create child theme and use this css ( https://github.com/coliff/bootstrap-ie8 ) created by @Coliff.
